Wifi module is in a small black box attached to the unit on the side. It has 4 wires for VCC, GND, TX and RX. 

- `DpId1` is the relay to turn unit on and off and is already mapped to FID11
- `DpId2Type3` is the current temperature in room

All data seems to be available but using rules to pass MQTT data to home assistant seems like the best way to control the unit, more information on that in the [Kogan panel heater template](kogan-KAHTP15WALA).
