Update 2020-11-13
Tuya-Convert does not work anymore you need to hard flash the chip directly with USB TTL cable (3.3v)
![chip_wires](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3240875/43324672-578ffcbc-917a-11e8-800c-f1d008ca3cf4.JPG)

Attach the GPIO0 wire to ground during initial boot to flash.  
A 3-pin header bridged together works great with GPIO0, GND and the GND from the USB flasher attached. 
(TX pin to RX pin and RX pin to TX pin on USB flash adapter). Verify that you are using 3.3volts to flash, **NOT 5V!**

After flash with Tuya-Convert and update to current release tasmota.bin :

- Go to WebUI and then Console
- Enter command `TuyaMCU 21,2`
- Set Dimmer Range with `DimmerRange 150,1000`

Now Dimmer Command should work from 0-100.

If no dimming occurs try changing the dimming mode:

- Dimming Mode 1: `SerialSend5 55AA00060005040400010013`
- Dimming Mode 2: `SerialSend5 55AA00060005040400010114`
- Dimming Mode 3: `SerialSend5 55AA00060005040400010215`

Dimming mode is reset after every reboot so add a rule at system boot.
```console
Rule1 on system#boot do SerialSend5 55AA00060005040400010114 endon
```
Enable with `Rule1 1`

The main button turns the switch on/off if single-clicked. 

If you double-click it, the brightness set point is reset to the stored favorite value (or 50.5% if no value has been stored since reset) - note that this wonâ€™t turn the switch on or off, just set the brightness with the switch staying on or off. 

If you triple-click it, the current brightness set point will be stored as the new favorite (overwriting the previous saved value).
