## CW/WW mode

If you use this controller with Cold White / Warm White LED strip (without RGB), use the following template:

```json
{"NAME":"Arilux LC06 in CW/WW mode","GPIO":[17,0,0,0,0,37,0,0,0,0,0,38,0],"FLAG":0,"BASE":18}
```

## XCSOURCE

The [XCSOURCE](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B01AA6221S/) branded version of this controller seems to have a different GPIO pin for the CW channel. The following template (9.1+) fixes the issue:

```json
{"NAME":"Arilux LC06","GPIO":[32,0,0,0,0,419,0,0,417,418,416,420,0,0],"FLAG":0,"BASE":18}
```
