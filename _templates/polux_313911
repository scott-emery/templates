Unfortunately the device comes with a newer Tuya firmware and tuya-convert does not work. One needs to disassemble the device and flash using serial method (soldering required).

To flash it you need to open the bottom cover which is hold by plastic holders around the base. Use screwdriver to lift the bottom. Inside there is a [TYWE3S](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Pinouts/#tywe3s) module, and on the bottom side - a Tuya MCU (MS51FB9AE).

MCU must be disabled while flashing by connecting RST and GND pads 

![Pads are on bottom side, left top corner](/assets/images/polux_313911_pinout.jpg)

Connect serial to [TYWE3S](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Pinouts/#tywe3s) pins on the top side, connect GPIO0 to GND and flash normally via serial. 

After flashing, set device to TuyaMCU (54) module and configure Tuya functions:

```console
Backlog TuyaMCU 11,20; TuyaMCU 26,21; TuyaMCU 21,22; TuyaMCU 23,23; TuyaMCU 24,24; DimmerRange 0,1000;
```

DpIds in my device are as follow:
- 20 on/off
- 21 mode enum; 0 - white, 1 - color, 2 and 3 - music (probably)
- 22 white dimmer with 0-1000 range
- 23 CCT, 0-1000 range; 0 is warm white, 1000 is cold white
- 24 RGB (Type 1, `0HUE0SAT0BRI0`)
- 25 unknown integer, does not seem to do anything

Device is unable to turn on both white and color light. It seems that mode 2 and 3 are 'music' modes. Sometimes the device is flashing white light after connecting to power, Tasmota seems to be unavailable in this state (constantly reseting?).  Holding down the button for ~10s seems the device to some usable state. There are no other functions of the button (no toggle, no brightness, no mode changes - even on original tuya firmware).
