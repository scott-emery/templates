The LeFun SK2 has 4 mains power and 4 USB ports. Each mains power is independently controlled and the USB group is controllable via a solid state relay. The ESP8266 module inside is likely a [TYWE3S](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Pinouts/#tywe3s) by Tuya but I didn't open the case and use the tuya-convert tool to flash.
