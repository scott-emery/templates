Device **does not** work with tuya-convert, as it never enters the required pairing mode (will only slow flash and output a wifi signal). To open the device, it is held in place with clips on the side & top/bottom (small screwdriver or opening tool highly recommended). Ground, 3.3v, Rx/Tx are all labeled.
