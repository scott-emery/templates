Similar to the Hyleton 317, this uses the Tuya [TYWE3S](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Pinouts/#tywe3s)module in place of the ESP8266, but using something such as tuya-convert can very easily convert the unit to Tasmota firmware. Blue LED on GPIO4, red LED on GPIO5, relay on GPIO12, button on GPIO13. Flash mode appears to be `1M QIO` on these units, but double-check during the tuya-convert process.
