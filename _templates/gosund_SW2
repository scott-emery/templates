To use the script, you have to compile Tasmota with [Scripting](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Scripting-Language) enabled. A precompiled binary from development branch is availiable [here](https://github.com/tasmota/binaries).

All dimming and on/off functionality is controlled by an MCU that does not follow the Tuya protocol.  Dimming and on/off can be set by Tasmota using simple serial commands.  Reading local dimming when set by the capacitive touch panel requires a Script-enabled build and the script below to process serial status codes sent by the dimmer MCU.

Status codes take the form of 24xx012123, with xx ranging from 01 to 64 (hex 1-100).

Minimum dimming level may vary by light fixture - adjust the ‘off’ value to match your setup in the >D section.

```lua
>D 100
rng=235
dimh=""
slider=0
power=0
dimval=1
a=""
b=""
c=""
d=0
f=0
g=""
;set the hex code below to the largest value possible that will turn off the relay with SerialSend5
off=0x7f

>B
dp0
rng-=off
=#scDim(dimval)

>E
a=SerialReceived
if sl(a)>0
then
g=sb(a 0 2)
if sl(a)==47
then
b=sb(a -5 2)
else
b=sb(a -8 2)
endif
a=""
if g=="24"
then
f=hd(b)
=>dimmer %f%
slider=f
dimval=slider
=#scDim(dimval)
=>SerialSend5 %dimh%
endif
else
slider=Dimmer
if chg[slider]>0
then
; dim according slider
if slider>0 and dimval!=slider
then
dimval=slider
=#scDim(dimval)

endif

#scDim(dimval)
