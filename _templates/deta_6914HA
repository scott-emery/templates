Decouple Buttons from Relays
```
SetOption73 1
```

Single rule to handle fan speed logic
```console
rule1
ON SYSTEM#Init DO VAR1 3 ENDON
ON BUTTON1#State=10 DO POWER1 Toggle ENDON
ON BUTTON2#State=10 DO POWER2 Toggle ENDON
ON POWER2#State=1 DO POWER3 ON ENDON
ON POWER2#State=1 DO POWER4 ON ENDON
ON POWER2#State=1 DO VAR1 2 ENDON
ON POWER2#State=0 DO POWER3 OFF ENDON
ON POWER2#State=0 DO POWER4 OFF ENDON
ON POWER2#State=0 DO VAR1 3 ENDON
ON BUTTON3#State=10 DO Event SetSpeed=%VAR1% ENDON
ON EVENT#SetSpeed=1 DO POWER3 OFF ENDON
ON EVENT#SetSpeed=1 DO POWER4 OFF ENDON
ON EVENT#SetSpeed=1 DO POWER2 ON ENDON
ON EVENT#SetSpeed=1 DO VAR1 3 ENDON
ON EVENT#SetSpeed=2 DO POWER3 OFF ENDON
ON EVENT#SetSpeed=2 DO POWER4 ON ENDON
ON EVENT#SetSpeed=2 DO POWER2 ON ENDON
ON EVENT#SetSpeed=2 DO VAR1 1 ENDON
ON EVENT#SetSpeed=3 DO POWER3 ON ENDON
ON EVENT#SetSpeed=3 DO POWER4 ON ENDON
ON EVENT#SetSpeed=3 DO POWER2 ON ENDON
ON EVENT#SetSpeed=3 DO VAR1 2 ENDON
```

Enable rule with `Rule1 1`

Description:
`SetOption73` Decouples the buttons and relay
The VAR1 can be thought of as "NextSpeed", if it makes it easier to read the code

Notes:
- Relay 1 is the main light relay controlled by button1 (the light button)
- Relay 2 is the main fan relay controlled by the button2 (the fan button)
- Relay 3 is the secondary fan relay controlled by the bottom3 (the array buttons)
- Relay 4 is the tertiary fan relay not physically connected to any buttons

Rule Logic
- Relay 3 and4 will always turn on with Relay 2
- VAR1 is set to 3 at Initialisation and when the fan is powered off to ensure full power to fan to startup
- Button 3 will always decrease speed one at a time 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 3
