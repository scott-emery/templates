"Power monitoring already working. Based on Teckin (52) plug but with the button connected on GPIO 3 and no additional LED on that pin. Red LED is hardwired with the relay. BL0937 chip as power meter. Uses TYWE2S Tuya ESP8265 MCU. I strongly recommend **NOT** loading more than 10 A or 2300 W (relay looks like a bit wimpy).

To open it, just pry the socket out. Then desolder the female output contacts and remove the protective white plastic. Then desolder the male prongs. Tip: twist them using a pliers while the tin is melted to ensure the connection is broken. To remove the board, either use a long nose pliers and grab it at the ground terminal holes or push it from behind using a thin screwdriver. **Take care not to damage any tracks** (had to fix three after that).

Haven't tried Tuya-convert.
