This is specifically for the CCT variant (Cool to warm white only)!

Template for the RGB+CCT (aka RGBWW) variant is [here](mirabella_genio_I002741.html)

Flashed wirelessly using Tuya-Convert: https://github.com/ct-Open-Source/tuya-convert

If the light turns off when dimming below 60%, enter the command `ledtable 0` to turn off hardware gamma correction.
