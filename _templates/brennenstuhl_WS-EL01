"To make full use of the device, you should use the rules below. With just the template:
* the *Learn* button toggles socket group 1
* The *All On/Off* button toggles socket group 1


### Simple rule
This rule switches the state of all switchable socket groups, and publishes a timestamp Json object to MQTT when the *Learn* button is pressed. A socket group that's ***on*** will switch ***off***, a socket group that's ***off*** will switch ***on***

`Backlog Rule1 ON Button3#state DO Power0 toggle ENDON ON Button4#state DO Publish stat/%topic%/Learn {""timestamp"":""%timestamp%""} ENDON; Rule1 ON;`

### More sophisticated Ruleset
This ruleset will switch all switchable socket groups ***off*** if, and only if, all switchable socket groups are ***on***. In all other cases, all switchable socket groups will be switched ***on***. It also publishes the same MQTT as the Simple rule above when pressing the *Learn* button.

`Backlog Rule1 ON Power1#Boot DO Add1 %value% ENDON ON Power2#Boot DO Add1 %value% ENDON ON Power1#state=1 DO Add1 1 ENDON ON Power1#state=0 DO Sub1 1 ENDON ON Power2#state=1 DO Add1 1 ENDON ON Power2#state=0 DO Sub1 1 ENDON ON Var1#state>1 DO Var2 0 ENDON ON Var1#state<2 DO Var2 1 ENDON ON Button3#state DO Power0 %var2% ENDON ON Button4#state DO Publish stat/%topic%/Learn {""timestamp"":""%timestamp%""} ENDON; Rule1 ON`

### Disable green connection LED
In case you rather like the connection LED to be ***off*** when the socket is connected to Wifi, use this template:

`{""NAME"":""WS EL01 DE"",""GPIO"":[19,18,0,17,21,22,0,0,52,0,0,53,157],""FLAG"":0,""BASE"":18}`

### Disable all LED's

To disable all LED's use this template. There will be ***no indicator*** if a switchable socket group is ***on*** or ***off***.

`{""NAME"":""WS EL01 DE"",""GPIO"":[19,18,0,17,21,22,0,0,0,0,20,0,0],""FLAG"":0,""BASE"":18}`
