Pre-flashed with TH3D version of firmware. You can update over wifi to standard Tasmota.

Converting the EZPlug from TH3D Firmware to Tasmota:

1. Download the latest tasmota-minimal.bin and flash it from the GUI
2. Download the latest tasmota.bin and flash it from the GUI
3. Reset the EZPlug configuration to clear out the config to prevent errors
4. Use it with standard Tasmota!
