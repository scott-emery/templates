### Synopsis
This assumes standard 3-way lighting with a child 'dumb' toggle switch connected to the travelers. 

### Components
Component | Description. 
--------- | -----------  
Relay1 | A dummy component that stores the power state of the switch.  
Relay2 | The actual hardware switch.  
Button1 | It's exactly what you think it is. When pushing the button it automatically TOGGLES Power1. 
Switch1 | The secondary switch electrically controls the light, and its state changes on Switch1.  

### Device Configuration
There are a couple things we need to do to get this switch to work correctly. 

#### SwitchTopic
This is normally set to 0 by default. This is the desired value. I recommend runnning anyways to make sure it is set. 
```console
SwitchTopic 0
```

For more information about SwitchTopic you can find it here: https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Buttons-and-Switches/#switchtopic

#### SwitchMode
Setting this to 1 allows for the switch to be a toggle and not just 1 or a 0

```console
switchmode1 1
```

For more information about SwitchMode you can find it here: https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Buttons-and-Switches/#switchmode

### Rules Configuration

#### Rule1
Updates the state of the dummy relay when switch1 changes state.
```console
Backlog Rule1 ON Switch1#state do Power1 2 endon; Rule1 1
```

#### Rule2
Toggles Power2 when the button is pressed.
```console
Backlog Rule2 ON Button1#state do Power2 2 endon; Rule2 1
```
#### Rule3
If the device is sent an EVENT it will Toggle Power2. 
```console
Backlog Rule3 ON event#OFF do power2 2 endon ON event#ON do power2 2 endon; Rule3 1
```

### Home Assistant Configuration

**SetOption19 should not be used in this setup!**

SetOption19 will expose both relays and will become very confusing to what the switch state is. 

#### Switch Confiugration
Below is an example I used to get this configuration working in Home assistant. 

```console
switch:
  - platform: mqtt
    name: "Exterior Lights"
    state_topic: "stat/tasmota_XXXXX/POWER1"
    command_topic: "cmnd/tasmota_XXXXX/EVENT"
    availability_topic: "tele/tasmota_XXXXX/LWT"
    qos: 0
    payload_on: "ON"
    payload_off: "OFF"
    payload_available: "Online"
    payload_not_available: "Offline"
```

Topic | Description
----- | -----------
state_topic | is based on the dummy relay on the smart switch. This is what tells Home Assistant if the light is on or off.
command_topic | This is what Home assistent will use to trigger [Rule3](#Rule3) on the device via MQTT.
