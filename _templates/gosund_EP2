## Warning
The Gosund EP2 is not easily opened as it contains no screws. 

The best way of opening it is to work your way around the clear plastic insert with a pair of pliers gently until the glue finally gives up.
Adding a little force with an rubber mallet or an pipe wrench on the shell could also help.
